Twoot is a customizable minimal twitter client for OSX. It is based on jQuery (http://jquery.com/), Fluid (http://fluidapp.com/) and some basic HTML and CSS. The idea is to provide a native-looking application that is easy to customize to your specific needs. The twitter javascript code is based on the SeaOfClouds tweet code (see http://tweet.seaofclouds.com/).

INSTALLATION
------------

Put all Twoot files in a folder somewhere. Download Fluid and create the Twoot.app by following the instructions here:

Change the username and password in twoot.js.

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------

The idea is that you should adapt Twoot to fit your requirements. If you know HTML and CSS it is trivial to add a new style. Create a new folder under the style directory and add all style files (css/images) there. Don't forget to change the stylesheet link in the twoot.htm file.

If you want to modify the way Twoot works, all javascript code is in the twoot.js file.
