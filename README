Twoot is a customizable minimal twitter client for OSX. It is based on jQuery (http://jquery.com/), Fluid (http://fluidapp.com/) and some basic HTML and CSS. The idea is to provide a native-looking application that is easy to customize to your specific needs. The twitter javascript code is based on the SeaOfClouds tweet code (see http://tweet.seaofclouds.com/).
